```
pip install python-binance
pip install finta
pip install mplfinance
```

Get an api key from binance and put it into creds.
Bot continuously scans btcusd 15minute chart and will alert you when price is overbought or oversold according to %b, then tweets it with a price chart. 
The type of trades it signals are often a high volatility scalp setup. 
I like to trade this by staying in position from 10 minutes to a couple hours, tops.
Not all signals are trades, sometimes its just noise and its telling you to just pay attention. 
If you have experience trading you will be able to filter the good signals manually.
